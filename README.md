This challenges utilizes data about Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), this data represents a Belly Button Biodiversity of different individuals, wich catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. A dashboard has been created to explore this dataset.

The data is from Hulcr, J. et al.(2012) A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, but Predictable. Retrieved from: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/

The dashboard displays the data with the following visualizations and information.
    * Horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found per individual
    * Bubble chart that displays all OTUs per individual
    * Test Subject ID No. as a dropdown menu, which allows the user to select an entry
    * Demographic Info of each test subject selected
The visualizations and demographic information is updated as each Test Subject ID No is selected. 


Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
